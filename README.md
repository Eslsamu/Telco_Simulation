# Telco_Simulation
Developing strategies for CSAs (costumer assistant agents) of a busy telco. These strategies consist of a roster and policies for the CSAs regarding how to handle incoming communication traffic. Strategies are based on analysing the data generated by simulating the system's traffic using given variables. 

To run the output analysis one needs to change the filepaths to the location of the .csv files in own directory in sections Data Retrieval: System 1 and Data Retrieval: System 1.

## Objective
The objective of this report is to develop a simulation environment (done in Java) which can be run with various sets of input
and offers an interface for data analysis of collected data. The data analysis (done in Matlab) in turn uncovers strategies which can be used interchangeably if needed. From this, two leading questions are derived:
1) Does one strategy lead to better better performance
given the same amount of corporate and
customer agents for each shift?
2) Can we say with confidence that a chosen roster
fulfils all performance requirements and has a
certain average waiting time for customers?
